The code example on this repository supports the Xprt Magazine article "From EventStorming to CoDDDing" and the [Techorama NL 2019](https://sched.co/QgvB) talk with the same title.

It provides a glimpse of the problems that we found across the years, and an implementation using the Domain Driven Design building blocks.
